# Spotify-Skip-Action-Prediction-Data-Science-Internship
Music providers are also incentivized to recommend songs that their users like in order to increase user experience and time spent on the platform. Machine learning in the context of music often uses recommender system. There hasn’t been much research on how a user’s interaction with music over time can help recommend music to the user.

# The project is divided into multiple stages: #

## 1- Dataset ##

*  Chose public spotify dataset which contains (Session data -Track features)
   **Check the dataset paper through this link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09851.pdf**
   
## 2- Track Features & Session Data ##

* In this, I have impleneted on dataset : 
*   1- Preprocessing on Data.
*   2- Data Wrngling (Handling Missing Data, Handling Categorical Data)
*   3- Feature Engineering
*   4- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)


## 3- Machine Learning Models ##

  * In this, I have Impleented some ML models:
  *  1-
